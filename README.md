# Noise-Cancellation-System
A Noise Cancellation System that is capable of precisely removing noise present in an audio signal using Python and Matplotlib, provided the noise has only one frequency. A song is created using a group of frequencies representing key strokes played on a piano. To this, a randomly generated frequency representing the noise is added. The system then searches for this noise by locating the frequency with the highest amplitude in the sound. Once identified, the noise is removed, resulting in the clean song. Youâ€™ll find graphs of the song with the noise added in both the time and frequency domains. By identifying the frequency with the highest amplitude, you can visually see the noise frequency. Additionally, a graph of the song after the identification and removal of the noise is provided.
